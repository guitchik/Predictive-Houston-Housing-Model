<h1>Houston Area House Price Prediction Modeling using Monte Carlo Simulation and FRED Data (2013-2022)</h1>

<h3>Group Members:  Ram Gollakota, Taylor Little and Celeste Terrell</h3>

<h2>Hyphothesis</h2>

We will develop a house pricing predictive model for the Houston area by analyzing data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and real estate firms, as well as other open source data. The model will use Monte Carlo simulation to make predictions about Houston area house prices for the period of 2023 to 2024. Our analysis will consider the impact of key factors such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), inflation, federal interest rate, and wages on Houston area house prices during the period of 2013 to 2022.

<h2>Questions to investigate from data</h2>

1. What is the average Houston area house price for the period of 2013 to 2022?
2. What is the trend of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the Houston area during the period of 2013 to 2022?
3. How does inflation impact Houston area house prices during the period of 2013 to 2022?
4. What is the correlation between the federal interest rate and Houston area house prices during the period of 2013 to 2022?
5. How do wages impact Houston area house prices during the period of 2013 to 2022?
6. How does the lumber price index influence Houston area house prices during the period of 2013 to 2022?
7. How does the price of oil impact the Houston area house prices during this period?
8. What is the standard deviation of Houston area house prices during the period of 2013 to 2022?
9. What is the distribution of Houston area house prices during the period of 2013 to 2022?
10. What are the key factors that influence Houston area house prices during the period of 2013 to 2022?
11. Are there any outliers in the Houston area house prices during the period of 2013 to 2022? If so, how do they impact the overall trend of house prices?

<h2>Predicting Housing Pricing using Monte Carlo and Scenario Analysis</h2>

We intend to do the following scenario based analysis to predict housing prices for 2023 onwward.

1. Base Scenario Analysis: This scenario considers the current trends in the housing market, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), inflation, federal interest rate, and wages. The data from FRED and real estate firms can be used to develop a baseline scenario and make predictions about housing prices in Houston for 2023 onward.
2. Interest Rate Scenario Analysis: This scenario considers the impact of changes in the federal interest rate on housing prices. The Monte Carlo simulation can be used to model the effect of different interest rate scenarios on housing prices in Houston.
3. Inflation Scenario Analysis: This scenario considers the impact of changes in inflation on housing prices. The Monte Carlo simulation can be used to model the effect of different inflation scenarios on housing prices in Houston.
4. Wages Scenario Analysis: This scenario considers the impact of changes in wages on housing prices. The Monte Carlo simulation can be used to model the effect of different wage scenarios on housing prices in Houston.
5. Lumber Price Scenario Analysis: This scenario considers the impact of changes in the lumber price index on housing prices. The Monte Carlo simulation can be used to model the effect of different lumber price scenarios on housing prices in Houston.

<h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>

Based on the scenario analyses identified above, we expect the data results to show the impact of various economic factors such as inflation, interest rate, wages, and the lumber price index on Houston housing prices. The Monte Carlo simulation will provide a range of possible outcomes for each scenario, taking into account the uncertainty and variability of the data. Our goal is to use these scenario analyses to understand the interplay of these factors and make informed predictions about the future of the Houston housing market.
